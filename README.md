# Student Performance Analytics

**Project Timeline**
- Originally completed: 2022

## Overview
This project analyzes a student performance dataset to uncover key factors that influence academic outcomes.  
It demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and clustering**.  

The aim is to identify which factors (like **study hours, attendance, and assignments**) impact student exam performance and to group students into performance categories.

---

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize data.  
- **EDA & Visualization** – Explore study habits, attendance, and performance with charts.  
- **Statistical Analysis**  
  - Regression → predict final exam scores based on study hours & attendance.  
  - Hypothesis testing → test if gender/study habits significantly affect scores.  
- **Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)** – Group students into High, Medium, and Low performance categories.  
- **Dashboard/Report** – Present insights in a simple dashboard/visual report.
